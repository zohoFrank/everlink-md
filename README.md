# EverlinkMD
A desktop application for combining Markdown with Evernote.

> I really like working with Evernote and Markdown. However, it is hard to find an editor to support both perfectly.  
> Alternatives are like [ever-notedown](https://atom.io/packages/ever-notedown) for Atom, [Evernote for Sublime Text](https://github.com/bordaigorl/sublime-evernote), both of which are not quite stable and convenient for me.  
> Also, [Marxico](https://maxiang.io/) is the best choice, but it is not an open source software.
